            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hello! I'm Samyak Jain, a recent high school graduate who is about to embark on an exciting academic journey by pursuing a Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) at IILM University, Gurugram. With a keen interest in data science, I am dedicated to building a strong foundation in statistics and programming languages, which are essential for a successful career in data analysis.</p>
            <p>My goal is to become a proficient data scientist, capable of analyzing complex data sets and predicting trends that can drive business growth. I am committed to working hard and continuously learning new skills that are in demand in the ever-evolving field of data science.</p>
            <p>Recently, I developed a basic calculator application using Python. This project, while simple, has given me practical experience with Python programming and a better understanding of fundamental concepts such as functions and user input handling. You can check out the project <a href="projects.html">here</a>.</p>
            <p>In my spare time, I enjoy watching Formula 1 races, which inspire me with their precision, strategy, and technological innovation. As I progress through my studies and gain more experience, I plan to add various projects to this portfolio to showcase my growth and expertise.</p>
            <p>Although I am just starting out and don't have many projects to display at the moment, I am eager to learn and create impactful work that will soon fill this space. Stay tuned for updates as I develop my skills and undertake new challenges in the world of data science.</p>
